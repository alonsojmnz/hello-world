# hello-world
My first repository!

Hey guys! I'm realchathe, otherwise known as chathe, or Chase. I'm trying to get back into the groove of things with coding, especially JavaScript and HTML so I'm gonna start as if I was new (I mean I basically am, a year of AP Comp Sci Principles taught me a bit but not everything). So yeah, hopefully I can learn and master my skills.


Check out this funny [4chan meme](https://www.4chan.org/).

is this the correct one? :)
